# WordSearch-Assign5
THE PROJECT IS A C++ CONSOLE BASED PROGRAM. IT SEARCHES A WORD FROM A GIVEN INPUT FILE AND PROVIDES THE POSITON OF THE WORD IN A SEPERATE FILE. IT ALSO CREATES A GRID OF WORDS IN FORM OF A PUZZLE. THE WORDS ARE GIVEN IN A SEPERATE INPUT FILE AND THE PROGRAM READS THEM.

I HAVE INPUT .TXT HAVING WORDS AND GRID.TXT HAVING AN EXISTING GRID OF WORDS.
